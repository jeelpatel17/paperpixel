        <article class="container">
            I still remember, when I was learning English(even though I completed my elementary education from an
            English medium school! this is a real problem in India, but we‚Äôll talk about that later in some other
            article) I used to watch a lot of English movies, listen to a lot of English songs (Eminem, JB, Kendrick
            Lamar are a few of them), talk to myself a lot in English, blah, blah. But one thing I noticed during all of
            them
            was that every time I heard of a new word, I use to search that word‚Äôs meaning immediately and after a few
            days, forget it, But if I heard that word again, I‚Äôd know that I had searched it, but don‚Äôt know its
            meaning, and then again I would search that word‚Äôs meaning, and that‚Äôs how my rich vocabulary box was built.
            I was tired of mugging up a long list of words and not be able to use it when needed, but I got this amazing
            ninja technique to build a good lexical resource of mine, hence passing out with you too!
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">What kind of movies should you watch/songs you listen to?</h2>
            Watch your favorite genre of movies/music, But as well as watch/listen to those topics which are going to
            help you in your intention of learning English, whether it be for studying abroad, business purposes, or for
            a good job. Hence, if you‚Äôre wishing to study abroad, watch movies which are related to your studies and
            foreign culture, if you‚Äôre hoping to learn English for business purpose than watch entrepreneurial movies
            like The Founder, and Wolf of the Wall Street, and if you want to enhance your communication skills, there
            are movies like The Pursuit of Happyness and The Social Network! Just find a way out of the problem,
            remember,
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">What you‚Äôve to do now?</h2>
            Start watching English movies(even with captions, if you need), listen to English songs, and carefully hear
            the words used in the lyrics, and just after getting a new word every time, search it immediately with a few
            of its examples, and don‚Äôt mug up! just learn it, don‚Äôt worry if you remember it or not. After a few weeks,
            see your vocab graph changing with a drastic improvement.
You can also maintain a diary or notebook to record new words which you encounter. 
In this way, whenever you open that notebook you will remember the previously written words as you see them!

            Now, I want to share with you a fun incident happened this morning with me, I was just coming out of the
            bathroom after having a bath and there I saw a tiny baby cockroach, and say what, I was talking to him in
            English! You can now estimate my willingness to learn English according to that, often I talk to myself in
            English and say so many sentences and learn every time from it.
            <br><br>
            <i>So, that was my morning today, Filled with enthusiasm and dedication!</i>
