            <h3>She undirectly taught me how to survive in real life situations!</h3>

        <article class="container">
            Everyone has had that boring and arrogant principal or teacher while in primary school and have a hateful relationship with their principal because they‚Äôre being strict and schooly things like that. I was also one of a kind like that, but after I completed
            my primary school and now I‚Äôm in a college, I‚Äôve realized that there were certain lessons from my primary school principal which I ignored were making a lot of sense and were depicting the world‚Äôs scenario, and how the world works! I‚Äôm gonna
            share those lessons with you, so you can also tell them to your child or your loved ones‚Äô child.
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">1. ‚ÄòWhoever wants to do, does!‚Äô</h2>
            I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôd not get this one right away after reading it, give me a chance! So, I still remember that my principal used to this phrase every time we children were doing some kind of mischief or not good at studies, but now I realized what she
            was trying to say, that is ‚ÄòWhere there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way!‚Äô. I realized that if anyone wants to do something or achieve some goal, he/she achieves it, without any excuses and arguments, just pure will power and dedication!
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">2. ‚ÄòMy Life is Blank White Paper and it died like a Blank White Paper‚Äô</h2>
            My principal was reciting this maybe 3‚Äì4 times a day (not in English, but Hindi ‚Äî Mera jivan kora kagaz, kora hi reh gaya), but it did pay off! (to some students at least). Let me tell you what she‚Äôs trying to convince with this, she use to tell that
            our lives are like a blank paper and our actions are like the letters on it, the moment we‚Äôre born, the almighty God sanctions a fresh warm blank paper from a printer, and now you‚Äôve to fill it nicely with good deeds and with golden letters
            to be a role model for someone, and whenever I remember this, my brain also bombs out a famous quote of ‚Äòunknown‚Äô
            <br><br>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                " Your Life is Your Message to the World, Make Sure it‚Äôs Inspiring "
            </blockquote>
            She also used to say in its full version in Hindi ‚Äî ‚Äú Mera jivan kora kagaz kora hi reh gaya, hawa ka jhaunka aaya aur udd gaya! ‚Äù, English translated ‚Äî ‚Äú My life is a blank white paper, and when an air gust blew, it flowed like the trash in a hurricane.‚Äù
            So, don‚Äôt waste your lives partying and gossiping with friends, make sure your life‚Äôs paper isn‚Äôt blank on the death bed, fill it with good deeds, and don‚Äôt let any wind gust to blow your life‚Äôs paper into the never-ending hurricane of negativity.
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="bold">3. Whose problem is it?</h2>
            Whenever I use to forget my homework notebook at home and tell her that the very next day, she used to scold me with that phrase, ‚ÄúWhose problem is it?‚Äù and every time I used to hate her more and more because I didn‚Äôt know that simple phrase will teach
            me some lesson later in my life, now I realize that in the real world, if you haven‚Äôt done something, maybe you‚Äôve gone for an interview and forgot your needed documents, you aren‚Äôt going to tell the hr officer that you forgot those documents
            at home, it is not his problem, that is your problem that you forgot them at home, that was the lesson I got earlier in my primary school. If my homework wasn‚Äôt available, then that was ultimately my problem!
            <br><br> Now after ~3 years, I realize how she was teaching me the important aspects of life, and training me to face it.
